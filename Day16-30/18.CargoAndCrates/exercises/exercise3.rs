/*
TODO: Design a workspace structure for a web application project.
It should have:
1. A core library (`my-core`) containing domain logic.
2. A web api crate (`my-api`) that depends on `my-core`.
3. A CLI tool (`my-cli`) that also depends on `my-core`.

Write down the `Cargo.toml` content for the workspace root and the `my-api` crate.
