# GitHub Pages Configuration

This directory exists to satisfy the GitHub Pages build check if your repository is currently configured to build from `/docs` on the `main` branch.

**Please change your GitHub Pages settings to:**
- **Source:** Deploy from a branch
- **Branch:** `gh-pages`
- **Folder:** `/` (root)

Once you make this change, the `mdBook` documentation deployed by the GitHub Action will be visible.
